Description: TrueCrypt mounting and dismounting shell script
 This script simplifies the mounting and dismounting routine of a TrueCrypt volume. 
 .
 Note: TrueCrypt has to be installed to use this package!
 .
 It is recommend to use a keyfile for the decryption of the volume. Then this keyfile can be on a external SD card (token). The script can be used e.g. to mount a TrueCrypt volume while booting.
